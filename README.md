## Installation

**For Termux Setup:**
- Install mpv-android and termux:API app from f-droid.
- mpv-android: https://f-droid.org/en/packages/is.xyz.mpv/
- termux:API (Optional) : https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux.api/

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thornynepali/phub-cli.git
cd phub-cli
chmod +x install_termux.sh
./install_termux.sh
```

From source (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/curtosis-org/phub-cli.git
cd phub-cli
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

After installation, run from anywhere:

```bash
phub-cli
```

## Dependencies

phub-cli relies on external tools and system Python packages.
You must install these before running the installer.

# Required

- bash

- mpv

- fzf

- yt-dlp

- python3

- python3-bs4 (BeautifulSoup)

### Arch Linux

```bash
sudo pacman -S mpv fzf yt-dlp python python-beautifulsoup4
```

### Debian / Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt install mpv fzf yt-dlp python3 python3-bs4
```

### Fedora

```bash
sudo dnf install mpv fzf yt-dlp python3 python3-beautifulsoup4
```
### macOS (Homebrew)

```bash
brew install mpv fzf yt-dlp python
pip3 install beautifulsoup4
```

## Usage

```bash
phub-cli
```
You will be presented with:

- Browse categories

- Search videos

- Quit

Navigation is entirely keyboard-driven using fzf.

## Fixing errors
If a video fails to play:

- It may be geo-blocked
- It may be removed
- It may require cookies/login

phub-cli will:
- detect fast failures 
- return you to the selection menu

allow retry or navigation without crashing

Ensure your dependencies are up to date:
```bash
yt-dlp -U
```

## Technical Notes

- Uses yt-dlp to resolve stream URLs before playback
- mpv is used only as a player, not as a scraper
- Input is explicitly read from /dev/tty to avoid fzf / mpv stdin conflicts
- No PhantomJS dependency
- No virtualenv required
- No downloads unless you modify the scripts yourself

## Supported Platforms

Tier 1 (tested)

- Linux (Arch, Debian, Fedora)
- macOS

Tier 2 (may work)

- WSL
- Termux (manual setup)

Windows, iOS, and consoles are not officially supported.
